The Project of Team Tatooine - Simple game, written in Java

<h1>THE EMPIRE STRIKES LEFT</h1>

<h4>A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...</h4>

It is a period of war. Empire<br />
spaceships, coming from the Deathstar 2.0<br />
have successfully invaded the planet of<br />
Tatooine and killed all of its population.<br />
Or at least they thought they did...<br />
<br />
A lonely Jawa by the name of Solo<br />
is one of the few survivors on this<br />
desert planet. Little does Solo know,<br />
the fight for his home planet will not<br />
be easy, nor will it end quickly...<br />

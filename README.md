THE EMPIRE STRIKES LEFT

A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...

It is a period of war. Empire
spaceships, coming from the Deathstar 2.0
have successfully invaded the planet of
Tatooine and killed all of its population.
Or at least they thought they did...

A lonely Jawa by the name of Solo
is one of the few survivors on this
desert planet. Little does Solo know,
the fight for his home planet will not
be easy, nor will it end quickly...
